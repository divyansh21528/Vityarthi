\# Simple ATM System

\## Overview

This program simulates a simple ATM system that allows users to withdraw
and deposit money, check their balance, and exit the system, all
protected by a PIN verification process.

\## Problem Statement

Users need a secure and convenient way to perform basic banking
transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries
without visiting a bank. The system should prevent unauthorized access
using PIN verification.

\## Scope of the Project

The system offers an interactive command-line interface for basic ATM
functions with PIN verification. It maintains balance in-memory during
runtime and does not link to actual bank accounts or databases.

\## Target Users

\- Individuals wanting to simulate ATM banking operations.

\- Beginners learning programming concepts related to input validation,
conditionals, and loops.

\- Educators demonstrating simple secure transaction systems.

\## High-Level Features

\- PIN verification before any sensitive operation.

\- Withdraw funds with balance checks.

\- Deposit funds to increase balance.

\- Check current balance.

\- Menu-driven interface to navigate options.

\- Exit option to safely close the application.

\## Usage Instructions

\- Run the program in a Python interpreter.

\- Enter your PIN when prompted before performing transactions.

\- Use menu options 1--5 to navigate and execute functions.

\## Limitations

\- Balance data is temporary and lost when the program exits.

\- No real-world bank transaction integration.

\- Basic input validation; may not handle all edge cases.
